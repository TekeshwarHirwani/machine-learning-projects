# BERT Sequence Classification with PyTorch on Stanford NLI Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a sequence classification model using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) transformer model on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset. The implementation is done using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework.

## Natural Language Inference (NLI)
Natural Language Inference is a task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) where the goal is to determine the relationship between a pair of sentences. These relationships are typically categorized into three types: entailment, contradiction, and neutral. The SNLI dataset provides a rich set of sentence pairs annotated with these relationships, making it a standard benchmark for NLI tasks.

## BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
BERT is a transformer model introduced by Google, designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of NLP tasks, including sequence classification, question answering, and more.

## Libraries and Frameworks Used
- `PyTorch`: Used for building and training the deep learning model.
- `Transformers`: Provides access to the pre-trained BERT model and related utilities.
- `pandas`: For loading and manipulating the SNLI dataset.
- `numpy`: Used for numerical operations.

## Dataset
The Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset is used for this task, and it is expected to be pre-processed and split into training, validation, test, and evaluation sets.

## Data Preparation
Labels are extracted from each dataset split, and the text data is tokenized using BERT's tokenizer. The tokenized data and labels are then converted into PyTorch tensors and grouped into datasets.

## Model
A BERT model specifically designed for sequence classification is loaded from the Hugging Face model repository. The model is configured to have three output labels, corresponding to the three NLI categories: entailment, contradiction, and neutral.

## Training and Evaluation
The model is set up to run on a GPU if available, ensuring faster training and evaluation times. An AdamW optimizer is used for training, and data loaders are created for each dataset split. The model is then trained for several epochs, and its performance can be evaluated on the validation, test, or evaluation sets.

## Conclusion
This project showcases how to implement a BERT-based sequence classification model on an NLI task using the Stanford NLI dataset and PyTorch. It covers the entire workflow from data preparation, through model training, to evaluation, providing a comprehensive example for similar NLP tasks.
