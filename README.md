# Machine Learning Projects 🎉🤖

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to the vibrant collection of my machine-learning escapades! I'm Tekeshwar Hirwani, navigating through my final year of B.Tech in Biomedical Engineering at the esteemed NIT Raipur. Dive into this treasure trove to discover a medley of projects, each narrating its unique tale of data, algorithms, and (a bit of) magic!

## [Driver Drowsiness Detection](Driver_drowsiness) 😴🚗
*When your car cares enough to say, "Hey, maybe it's time for a coffee break!"*

This project is all about keeping those peepers open on the road! Utilizing the mystical powers of Python, OpenCV, and dlib, we’re on a mission to detect driver drowsiness in the blink of an eye (pun intended)!

### Technologies Used
- OpenCV: Capturing your good side and those sleepy eyes!
- dlib: Because faces are more than just a pretty smile, we need those landmarks.
- NumPy: Crunching numbers like a boss.
- imutils: Making image processing as easy as pie.

### Overview
We’re playing Sherlock with facial landmarks to keep tabs on your eye aspect ratio. Too many frames with closed eyes? That’s a red flag! The system gently nudges you back to alertness, ensuring that the road ahead is as clear as your conscience (we hope).

## [Parkinson's Disease Detection](parkinsons-disease) 🗣️🕵️
*Turning voice waves into waves of hope.*

We’re on a mission to detect Parkinson's Disease through the power of voice measurements. Because every voice matters, and we’re here to listen.

### Technologies Used
- Python: Back at it again!
- Scikit-Learn: For all our classification needs.
- XGBoost: Boosting our way to accurate predictions.

## [SNLI Dataset Model BERT](snli-dataset-model-bert) 📚🤓
*Where BERT meets datasets and magic happens.*

Dive deep into the world of natural language inference with BERT. It's like having a wise sage in your computer, understanding languages on a whole new level.

### Technologies Used
- PyTorch: Lighting the way for deep learning.
- Transformers: Not the robots, but equally cool for handling sequences.
- Pandas: Data’s best friend.

## [YoLov3 Object Detection from Scratch](YoLov3_Object_detection_from_scratch) 🕵️‍♂️🔍
*For when you've lost your keys again... but way more advanced.*

This project is all about having eagle-eyed precision in real-time object detection. Thanks to YOLO v3, we’re making “You Only Look Once” a reality and not just a cool catchphrase.


---

## [Bulldozer Price Prediction](bulldozer-price-prediction) 🚜💸
*"How much for that bulldozer in the window?"* 

This project is like the "Antiques Roadshow" but for bulldozers at auctions. We’re predicting future prices like a financial wizard, ensuring you get the bang for your buck!


---

## [Heart Disease Prediction](heart-disease) ❤️🏥
*Because your heart deserves all the TLC!*

Here, we’re on a quest to predict heart disease because we believe in taking care of tickers to keep them ticking!
