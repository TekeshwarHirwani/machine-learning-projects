# YOLOv3 Object Detection from Scratch

This repository contains an implementation of YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) object detection algorithm from scratch using PyTorch. YOLOv3 is a popular object detection algorithm that is fast and efficient, capable of detecting objects in real-time.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- PIL
- albumentations
- pandas
- matplotlib
- tqdm

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install torch numpy opencv-python pillow albumentations pandas matplotlib tqdm
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/yolov3-objectdetection-scratch.git
   cd yolov3-objectdetection-scratch
   ```

2. **Prepare the Dataset**

   (Instructions for preparing the dataset)

3. **Modify the Configuration**

## Features

- YOLOv3 object detection algorithm implemented in PyTorch
- Custom dataset loading and preprocessing
- Data augmentation using albumentations
- Intersection over Union (IoU) and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) for accurate bounding box predictions
- Model checkpoint saving and loading
- Real-time object detection visualization
